Quadratic Equation Program Diagram Flow:
Start
Start → Prompt the user to input coefficients a, b, and c.

Input Validation
Check if a == 0:

Yes: Print "Not a quadratic equation" → End.

No: Continue to calculate discriminant.

Calculate Discriminant
Compute discriminant = b² - 4ac.

Check Discriminant
Check discriminant value:

If discriminant > 0:

Compute two real roots using the quadratic formula.

Print the roots (real and different).

If discriminant == 0:

Compute one real root using the quadratic formula.

Print the root (real and same).

If discriminant < 0:

Compute the real and imaginary parts of the roots.

Print the complex roots.

End
End the program.
